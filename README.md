# dedekind-kummer-theorem

This is a repo on which I am planning (as soon as I find some time to organise it!) to store some of the code I wrote in Lean during summer 2021 to prove the [Dedekind-Kummer theorem](https://kconrad.math.uconn.edu/blurbs/gradnumthy/dedekindf.pdf). 

Most of what I wrote have already made its way into mathlib :
- [Results about sums of ideals in Dedekind domains](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/9055), 
- [Results about quotients of polynomial rings](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/9542),
- Results about successive quotients of rings : [here](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/8668) and [here](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/9649),
- [Results about UFDs](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/9108),*
- Results about multisets : [here](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/9038) and [here](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/9038),
- Results about quotients of various structures : [here](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/8640) and [here](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/8617).
- [Results about divisibility](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/10941),
- [Results about UFDs](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/9345),*
- [Results about Dedekind domains](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/11053).
- [Results about order theory](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/14872)
- [...]
- [The Dedekind-Kummer Theorem in the monogenic case](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/15000)
- [Basic theory of conductor ideals - all the stuff that's needed for the general version of the Dedekind-Kummer Theorem](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/16833)

*To be more precise these results are proved in the more general setting of Unique Factorisation Monoids.
